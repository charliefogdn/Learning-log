I kicked off this homelab project by gathering the basic tools I needed to get started: a Raspberry Pi, power supply, microSD card, and the essentials for connecting it into my network. 
It’s a small setup, but perfect for experimenting alongside my cybersecurity and Linux fundamentals work.

Once everything arrived, I prepared the microSD card with the operating system and got the Pi booted for the first time. 
This gave me a clean foundation to build on and marked the start of turning the hardware into something actually useful.

After the initial setup, I focused on configuring the Pi so I could manage it remotely from my laptop. 
Setting up SSH and giving the device a stable presence on my network made it easy to work on it without needing a monitor or peripherals attached.

With remote access sorted, I installed CasaOS and connected it to my home network. 
It’s now running smoothly and gives me a simple interface for managing apps and services as I continue expanding the homelab.
