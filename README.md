# Learning Log

This repository documents my journey learning:

- Linux
- Home lab setup
- Cybersecurity fundamentals

I am learning from scratch and self-taught, and this repo is used to track:
- What I’m working on
- What I’ve learned
- My progress over time

This is a learning log, so many things may be wrong, but that is where you learn.
